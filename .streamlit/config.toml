# Below are all the sections and options you can have in ~/.streamlit/config.toml.

[global]

# By default, Streamlit checks if the Python watchdog module is available and, if not, prints a warning asking for you to install it. The watchdog module is not required, but highly recommended. It improves Streamlit's ability to detect changes to files in your filesystem.
# If you'd like to turn off this warning, set this to True.
# Default: false
disableWatchdogWarning = false

# If True, will show a warning when you run a Streamlit-enabled script via "python my_script.py".
# Default: true
showWarningOnDirectExecution = true

# Level of logging: 'error', 'warning', 'info', or 'debug'.
# Default: 'info'
#logLevel = "debug"

[logger]

# Level of logging: 'error', 'warning', 'info', or 'debug'.
# Default: 'info'
level = "info"

# String format for logging messages. If logger.datetimeFormat is set, logger messages will default to `%(asctime)s.%(msecs)03d %(message)s`. See [Python's documentation](https://docs.python.org/2.6/library/logging.html#formatter-objects) for available attributes.
# Default: "%(asctime)s %(message)s"
messageFormat = "%(asctime)s %(message)s"



[client]

# Whether to enable st.cache.
# Default: true
caching = true

# If false, makes your Streamlit script not draw to a Streamlit app.
# Default: true
displayEnabled = true

# Controls whether uncaught app exceptions are displayed in the browser. By default, this is set to True and Streamlit displays app exceptions and associated tracebacks in the browser.
# If set to False, an exception will result in a generic message being shown in the browser, and exceptions and tracebacks will be printed to the console only.
# Default: true
showErrorDetails = true


[runner]

# Allows you to type a variable or string by itself in a single line of Python code to write it to the app.
# Default: true
magicEnabled = true

# Install a Python tracer to allow you to stop or pause your script at any point and introspect it. As a side-effect, this slows down your script's execution.
# Default: false
installTracer = false

# Sets the MPLBACKEND environment variable to Agg inside Streamlit to prevent Python crashing.
# Default: true
fixMatplotlib = true

# Run the Python Garbage Collector after each script execution. This can help avoid excess memory use in Streamlit apps, but could introduce delay in rerunning the app script for high-memory-use applications.
# Default: true
postScriptGC = true

# Handle script rerun requests immediately, rather than waiting for script execution to reach a yield point. Enabling this will make Streamlit much more responsive to user interaction, but it can lead to race conditions in apps that mutate session_state data outside of explicit session_state assignment statements.
# Default: false
fastReruns = false



[server]

# List of folders that should not be watched for changes. Relative paths will be taken as relative to the current working directory.
# Example: ['/home/user1/env', 'relative/path/to/folder']
# Default: []
folderWatchBlacklist = ['']

# Change the type of file watcher used by Streamlit, or turn it off completely.
# Allowed values: * "auto" : Streamlit will attempt to use the watchdog module, and falls back to polling if watchdog is not available. * "watchdog" : Force Streamlit to use the watchdog module. * "poll" : Force Streamlit to always use polling. * "none" : Streamlit will not watch files.
# Default: "auto"
fileWatcherType = "auto"

# If false, will attempt to open a browser window on start.
# Default: false unless (1) we are on a Linux box where DISPLAY is unset, or (2) server.liveSave is set.
headless = true

# Automatically rerun script when the file is modified on disk.
# Default: false
runOnSave = false

# The port where the server will listen for client and browser connections.
# Default: 8501
port = 80

# Enables support for Cross-Origin Request Sharing, for added security.
# Default: true
enableCORS = true

maxMessageSize = 400

[browser]

# Internet address of the server server that the browser should connect to. Can be IP address or DNS name.
# Default: 'localhost'
serverAddress = "localhost"

# Whether to send usage statistics to Streamlit.
# Default: true
gatherUsageStats = true

# Port that the browser should use to connect to the server when in liveSave mode.
# Default: whatever value is set in server.port.
